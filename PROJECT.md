## Project Design

**Canvas Functions** - dynamic nodes, docs, folders, properties and views - "Postit Cards"

- A canvas holds "nodes" and allows the organization of nodes into dynamic structures.
  - Nodes are the most basic data structure.
    - You can create new nodes, edit existing nodes, delete nodes, style nodes, and transform nodes
    - Nodes are customizable using **_enhancers_**
    - We use a **_markdown engine_** to enhance the node structure.
  - NODES can be organized inside DOCS. Docs are collections of Nodes
  - Docs can be placed in folders.
  - Folders store different properties about the docs inside.
  - Folders provide different ways to view or organize the canvas
