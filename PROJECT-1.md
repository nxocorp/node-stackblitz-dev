## Project Idea 1 - Outline

We will also be breaking down the course into modules to help better understand each component, integrating project .

- [ ] set up our wIDE
- [ ] determine framework to use
- [ ] design our applications using online tools
- [ ] implement a project plan and organize our sprints
- [ ] start prototyping functionality and style
- [ ] integrate external tools for backend services
- [ ] deploy to public access to testing

## Project Design

**Canvas Functions** - dynamic nodes, docs, folders, properties and views - "Postit Cards"

- A canvas holds "nodes" and allows the organization of nodes into dynamic structures.
  - Nodes are the basic data structure that can be interacted locally or by the buckets they are assigned.
    - You can create new nodes, edit existing nodes, delete nodes, style nodes, transform nodes
    - Nodes are dynamic using **_enhancers_**
    - We use a **_markdown engine_** to write and enhance the node.
  - NODES can be organized inside DOCS. Docs are collections of Nodes
  - Docs can be placed in folders/buckets.
  - Folders behave as databases and add properties to the docs inside.
  - Folders provide different ways to view or organize the canvas

#### EXAMPLES:

NODE: short string, underneath we track ID, CREATED, UPDATED, USER
The node can be expanded making the string its title and the expansion a sub string.
Adding a "@" character triggers the USER CONNECTION MODAL, which provides a list of active users
