# NXOCORP DOJO

Welcome to **NXOCORP W.IDE LAB**

> [Edit me on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-stack-dev)

We will be exploring the possibilities of using the **StackBlitz WebIDE** to develop a production ready web/mobile application with local and Cloud services. We will be focussing on using modern reactive JavaScript frameworks and connecting to external services when needed.

Our project intends to use an off the shelf android mobile devices, converting it to a LINUX SERVER that runs a database and deploy a modern reactive application that can be access locally trough a wireless network or remotely via cellular networks. This application will provide encrypted peer to peer communication, storage services, media distribution platform and a payment node.

People who connect to the wireless network will be prompted to authenticate and later redirected to the Landing were they will find one or all of the following features:

1. PirateBox like device that allows for peer to peer communication, a shared wiki and distribution of media files.
1. Decentralized Streaming Service and Shopping Network powered by AI Agents
1. ... To Be Imagined ...
