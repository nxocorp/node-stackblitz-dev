# NXOCORP DOJO

Welcome to **NXOCORP W.IDE LAB**

> [Edit me on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-stack-dev)

We will be exploring the possibilities of using the **StackBlitz WebIDE** to code everything from SPA to Mobile Apps and Cloud services focusing on modern JavaScript frameworks and external services available.

## Introduction

To take control of this endevor, we will be using:

- **Notion** - Documentation and Project Management Application
- **Plasmic/Figma** - system Design and Prototyping

Our online development ecosystem and tools are:

- **Stackblitz** - Web IDE for Code development, testing and deployment

We will be exploring the latest Javascript frameworks like:

- **Vue**
- **React**
- **Angular**

And we will be using Backend services like:

- **Github** - Code repository and distribution
- **Firebase** - Database Storage, File Storage and Authentication

And finally we will be integrating AI based technologies to enhance our app.

- **GPT-4**
- **Midjourny**

Bonus: Hacker Man Implementation

- We will be turning a mobile phone into a private server
- Serve our application on the Web and/or in a private local network.

## Project Outline

We will also be breaking down the course into modules to help better understand each component, integrating project .

- [ ] set up our wIDE
- [ ] determine framework to use
- [ ] design our applications using online tools
- [ ] implement a project plan and organize our sprints
- [ ] start prototyping functionality and style
- [ ] integrate external tools for backend services
- [ ] deploy to public access to testing

## Project Design

**Canvas Functions** - dynamic nodes, docs, folders, properties and views - "Postit Cards"

- A canvas holds "nodes" and allows the organization of nodes into dynamic structures.
  - Nodes are the most basic data structure.
    - You can create new nodes, edit existing nodes, delete nodes, style nodes, and transform nodes
    - Nodes are customizable using **_enhancers_**
    - We use a **_markdown engine_** to enhance the node structure.
  - NODES can be organized inside DOCS. Docs are collections of Nodes
  - Docs can be placed in folders.
  - Folders store different properties about the docs inside.
  - Folders provide different ways to view or organize the canvas
